                <h3>Introduction to Web Applications</h3>
                <p>Web applications are a crucial component of modern web development, enabling interactive experiences and dynamic content delivery.

This accessibility promotes collaboration and user engagement, as web applications often support real-time interactions and updates. Built using various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side languages like PHP, web applications can handle complex tasks, manage data, and offer a seamless user experience across different platforms.</p>
